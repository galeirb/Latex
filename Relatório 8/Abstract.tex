\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
In this report, it was studied the implementation of a fixed polarization circuit and polarization circuit by voltage divider. The theoretical and experimental analyzes of these circuits were carried out, as well as obtaining the points of operation of the circuits. We also performed the analysis of how some operating points reacted and varied according to temperature variations and the comparison of the values ​​obtained theoretically and the experimental values. \\
 \noindent
 \textbf{Keyword}: bipolar transistor, temperature, stability
