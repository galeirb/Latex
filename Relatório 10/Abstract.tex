\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
The present practice is based on the assembly of the circuits with the transistor $ 2N3391 $, being simulated using the software MULTISIM, a manager of functions with a voltage of $ 1,0mV $ and frequency $ 1 kHz $ and with the gain generated, we analyzed the relationship with frequency. Using the Bode diagram, it is a way of characterizing signals in the frequency domain. And presentation of filter concepts, presenting a practical example of this application.\\

\textbf{Keyword}: bode plots, frequency, amplifier
