\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
In this report, it was study the implementation of a transistor as a source of electric current to suply a light emitting diode. The theoretical analysis and the pratical analysis of the points of operation of the circuit were carried out. Then, a comparison was made between those obtained theoretically and the values obtained experimentally. \\
 \noindent
 \textbf{Keyword}: bipolar transistor, current source, NPN
