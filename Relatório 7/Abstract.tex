\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
In this report, the implementation of a transistor was studied as a source of electric power for UMM led. Theoretical analysis was conducted and the practical analysis of the circuit's operational points. Then a comparison was conducted between theoretically obtained and the experimentally obtained values. \\
 \noindent
 \textbf{Keyword}: bipolar transistor, current source, NPN
